However, it is questionable whether these tools address todays clinical needs. Early assessment during the development of new AI for radiology helps developers create more value for their tool while providing end-users with greater transparency on the risks and benefits of the AI. In this work, they (Erik with the co-authors, in particular, Martijn from the BIGR) describe the concept of early health technology assessment and outline the changes needed to assess AI for radiology. Practical methods and examples of performed early health technology assessments are provided, showing how it can be applied to AI in radiology.\nüí° Key takeaways: Value in radiology AI should be perceived as a comprehensive term including health technology assessment domains and AI-specific domains. Incorporation of an early health technology assessment for radiology AI during development will lead to more valuable radiology AI tools. Comprehensive and transparent value assessment of radiology AI tools is essential for their widespread adoption.\n","date":1733270400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1733270400,"objectID":"a85f3fed355304c58d7259d8651915e1","permalink":"https://example.com/post/paper-erik-2024-dec/","publishdate":"2024-12-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/paper-erik-2024-dec/","section":"post","summary":"Erik has studied the use of early health technology assessment in the radiology AI development to facilitate value-based AI and thereby bridge the gap between research and clinical practice. and his considerable contribution were outlined in the paper, ‚ÄúESR Essentials: how to get to valuable radiology AI: the role of early health technology assessment‚Äîpractice recommendations by the European Society of Medical Imaging Informatics‚Äù\n","tags":null,"title":"New Paper Erik Kemper - How to get Valuable Radiology AI","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This paper introduces the Radiology AI Deployment and Assessment Rubric (RADAR), a comprehensive framework for the value assessment of artificial intelligence in radiology.\n1Ô∏è‚É£ RADAR adapts Fryback and Thornbury‚Äôs imaging efficacy framework for radiology AI, emphasizing the valuation from conception to local implementation.\n2Ô∏è‚É£ It presents a seven-level hierarchy to guide radiologists, researchers, and policymakers through the comprehensive assessment of radiology AI‚Äôs value.\n3Ô∏è‚É£ The framework integrates clinical integration and cost-effectiveness, utilizing study designs like in silico clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, and health economic evaluations.\n4Ô∏è‚É£ RADAR emphasizes local efficacy, highlighting the importance of assessing AI technology within its specific environment.\n5Ô∏è‚É£ It aims to bridge the gap in the implementation of AI in clinical radiology, ensuring technologies are assessed thoroughly for their clinical and economic value.\nThe paper advocates for a dynamic approach to the evaluation of AI in radiology, aligning with principles of value-based radiology and addressing the need for a standardized method in comprehensive AI valuation.\n‚úçüèª Bart-Jan Boverhof, Ken Redekop, Daniel Bos et al.
